# An IoT Network Intrusion Detection and Classification System with XGBoost using CICIoT2023 Dataset
Master of Data Science Project

This project is aimed at developing a robust classification system to identify diverse IoT intrusions, using both binary and multiclass classification methods. Due to resource constraints, it utilizes a subset of the extensive CICIoT2023 dataset from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity, which includes 7,332,065 out of the total 46,686,748 records and 47 attributes for model development. Furthermore, 446,796 records are set aside to evaluate the model’s effectiveness on previously unseen datasets. This dataset simulates smart home IoT scenarios and includes detailed data from 33 different attacks executed within an IoT topology of 105 devices. It is categorized into seven attack classes: DDoS, DoS, Recon, Web-Based, Brute Force, Spoofing, and Mirai, as well as a normal class labelled ‘Benign’. The project begins with a comprehensive data preprocessing and EDA phase using Alteryx and Python. The analysis will then focus on the impact of the Top 25 features selected using Random Forest and Extra Trees on the performance of the XGBoost model. Following optimization of the XGBoost model through hyperparameter tuning, including adjustments to class weights and L1 and L2 regularizations, the effectiveness of the model will be assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project will conclude with the creation of an interactive dashboard interface that showcases the trained models’ predictive capabilities on new, unseen datasets, providing a detailed evaluation of the system’s performance in detecting IoT intrusions.
