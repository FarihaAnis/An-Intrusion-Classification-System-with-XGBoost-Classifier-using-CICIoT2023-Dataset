# An-IoT-Network-Intrusion-Classification-System-with-XGBoost-Classifier-using-CICIoT2023-Dataset
Master of Data Science Project

This project is dedicated to strengthening cybersecurity within the rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. It revolves around the creation and evaluation of an advanced intrusion classification system, leveraging the CICIoT2023 dataset from the University of New Brunswickâ€™s Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity website to accurately simulate real-world IoT attack scenarios. Utilizing the XGBoost algorithm for its precision and adaptability, the project focuses on classifying IoT network traffic, employing metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score. Its significance lies in enhancing IoT security and shaping future security strategies.

Appendix B, attached in this GitHub repository, includes the Alteryx Workflow and Jupyter Notebook coding used in the research. These resources are invaluable for understanding the technical aspects and methodologies employed. The project's ongoing efforts involve optimizing the classification system, exploring alternative machine learning algorithms, and adapting to evolving cyber threats to secure the expanding IoT landscape.
